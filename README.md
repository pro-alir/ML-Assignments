# Machine Learning Assignments

This repository contains a series of machine learning assignments focused on different aspects of machine learning, such as data exploration, model implementation, evaluation, and optimization.

## Assignment 1: Heart Disease Prediction and Perceptron

### Objective:
Predict heart disease diagnosis using the Heart Disease dataset, implement a Perceptron model with Stochastic Gradient Descent, and compare it with a Naive Bayes classifier.

### Key Tasks:
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implement and evaluate a Perceptron model
- Compare with a Naive Bayes model
- Handle and analyze imbalanced data

## Assignment 2: Polynomial Regression and Regularization

### Objective:
Explore polynomial regression and apply L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques to improve model performance and prevent overfitting.

### Key Tasks:
- Create a synthetic dataset and train polynomial regression models
- Implement Lasso and Ridge regression
- Compare model performance using MSE and RÂ² scores

## Assignment 3: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

### Objective:
Implement SVM for binary classification, extend to multiclass classification, and explore different SVM kernels.

### Key Tasks:
- Implement soft margin SVM and compare different kernels (RBF, Polynomial, Sigmoid)
- Train and evaluate multiclass SVM
- Analyze performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Assignment 4: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Bank Marketing Classification

### Objective:
Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from scratch and apply neural network classification using PyTorch on the bank marketing dataset.

### Key Tasks:
- Implement KNN from scratch and compare with sklearn
- Build and train a PyTorch neural network for classification
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics

## Assignment 5: PCA and K-Means Clustering

### Objective:
Implement Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and K-Means clustering for unsupervised learning.

### Key Tasks:
- Implement PCA from scratch and analyze the results
- Implement K-Means clustering and determine optimal clusters using elbow and silhouette methods
- Compare custom K-Means with sklearn implementation
